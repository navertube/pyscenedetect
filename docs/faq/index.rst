Text-to-Speech (TTS) FAQ
=======================

Introduction
------------
Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology converts written text into audible speech. This FAQ aims to address common questions regarding `TTS <https://unlimited.readthedocs.io/tts/>`_.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

1. **What is Text-to-Speech (TTS)?**
   
   TTS is a technology that converts digital text into spoken voice output. It's often used to make content more accessible to those who prefer auditory learning or have visual impairments.

2. **How does TTS work?**

   TTS systems typically involve two main processes: text processing, where the text is analyzed for pronunciation and intonation, and speech synthesis, where the processed text is converted into sound.

3. **Why is TTS important?**

   TTS promotes accessibility, especially for the visually impaired. It also aids in e-learning, navigation systems, and content consumption, among other applications.

4. **Does TTS sound robotic?**

   Early TTS systems often had a robotic tone. However, advancements in AI and deep learning have resulted in more natural-sounding voices in modern TTS systems.

5. **Can I customize the voice in TTS systems?**

   Yes, many TTS systems allow users to select from various voices, adjust pitch, speed, and sometimes even apply specific intonations.

6. **Is there a difference between TTS and voice assistants like Siri or Alexa?**

   Yes. While TTS is a component in voice assistants to read aloud responses, voice assistants integrate various other technologies, including voice recognition and AI, to understand and process user queries.

7. **Are there free TTS software available?**

   Yes, there are open-source and free TTS tools available, such as `espeak` and `festival` for Linux. Many online platforms also offer basic TTS services for free.

8. **Can TTS be used in multiple languages?**

   Absolutely. Modern TTS systems support multiple languages and dialects, although the quality and naturalness might vary across languages.

9. **How can I integrate TTS into my website or app?**

   There are several TTS APIs, like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or IBM Watson Text to Speech, that developers can integrate into websites or apps to provide voice output.

10. **Is there a difference between Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text?**

    Yes. While TTS converts written text into voice, Speech-to-Text (STT) does the opposite: it converts spoken language into written text.

Conclusion
----------
TTS technology has come a long way and continues to evolve. Its applications span numerous domains, ensuring content is more accessible and interactive.
