Text-to-Speech (TTS)
======================

Definition
----------
Text-to-speech (TTS) is a form of assistive technology that converts written text into audible speech. This conversion is widely employed to aid those with visual impairments, reading disabilities, and in applications such as GPS, e-learning, and content creation.

How Text-to-Speech Works
------------------------

1. **Text Processing**
   
   - The input text is processed initially. This conversion incorporates punctuation, capitalization, and numbers, which can influence the intonation and rhythm of the resulting speech.
   - Tokenization occurs, breaking down extensive text into smaller units like sentences or words.

2. **Linguistic Analysis**

   - A linguistic examination determines the pronunciation of each word. Homographs, words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently based on their context, are managed using rules to deduce the correct pronunciation.

3. **Speech Synthesis**

   - The speech is synthesized once the system identifies the sounds to produce. Historically, two main methods were employed:
     
     a. **Concatenative TTS:** Utilizes vast databases of pre-recorded speech. Each word or phoneme is recorded multiple times, then assembled to produce fluid speech.
     
     b. **Formant TTS:** Synthesizes speech by generating the vocal tract shapes and sounds characteristic of human speech, though it may sound more robotic.

4. **Deep Learning and Neural Networks**

   - Modern TTS systems often use deep learning. Neural networks, especially recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers, are trained on large datasets to produce incredibly lifelike speech.
   - Models like Google's Tacotron and WaveNet exemplify this, synthesizing realistic speech using neural networks.

5. **Output**

   - The synthesized speech is either broadcasted through a speaker or stored as an audio file.

With continual advancements in AI and deep learning, TTS technology is becoming more realistic and adaptable in its applications.
